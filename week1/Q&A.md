## Danijel Cvitkusic

Q1: Should we always use `async/await` syntax if possible and only fallback to `promise.then()` syntax when necessary or is it more nuanced than that?

A1:

Q2: How do we handle existing library/package functions that use callbacks, can we convert these to async/await or promise syntax ?

Q1: My question for this week is regarding the Practice the concepts part on the MAKEME.md .. so the first link provided was so clear & easy to follow, I felt that I really got the concept & that's I was able to implement it through practical example. However, the second link https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/347/javascript-promises-mastering-the-asynchronous/what-is-asynchronous-in-javascript
left me confused & they used slightly different syntax which really made me list. Plus when we don't get the solution there is no hint or useful error message .. I got stuck on 8/17.
If possible I would like to know why they used different syntax & which one we should use & maybe go through some of the examples from the link.

Q1: In HYF curriculum, a resource mentioned that for asynchronous JavaScript;

- Using Callbacks is `good`
- Using Promises is `better`
- Using Generators is `awesome`

But resources in curriculum focus on Promises. So, do we need to learn it additionally or Promises are enough for us?

A1:

## Mustafa Sh

Q1: Hello there, I still don't get what's the best practice to call promises. Should we call them after it's created, or later on? and how should we organize our code in a professional way?

## Lydia Samir

Q1: my question related to ex3 . catching error is the end of the promise or not ? i mean in this exercise it didnt stop after catching the error (Dice rolled out of table)

## Alexander Said

Q1: With "Asynchronous" we can keep the code running. Are there situations when the code in some point will rely on the asynchronous' return? if so how we avoid the blocking then?
